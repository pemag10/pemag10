# Hi ðŸ™Œ

I am a web developer who primarily works with Django and Nuxt, and I absolutely love Django!

Currently, most of my repositories are private, but I have aspirations to contribute to open-source projects, including Django, in the future.

I've developed an interest in machine learning recently as well. Nice to meet you!
