# Hi ðŸ™Œ

Thanks for taking a look at my Github!

I am a web developer and develop primarily using Django and Nuxt. (I love Django!)

Right now I mainly use private repositories, but in the future I would like to contribute to open source, including Django!

I'm interested in ML these days! Nice to meet you!
